One rainy day, Li Li went home by taxi. In the car she found (that) the driver was learning English. He said to Li Li: "I was weak in English when I was at school. Now I'm working hard at it to help with the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games." I think I should learn from the driver. English is very important to us because it is widely used all over the world. As a student, I'll do my best to learn English well at school. And I'm going to speak English as much as possible to show support for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.
